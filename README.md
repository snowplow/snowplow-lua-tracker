# UNFINISHED Snowplow Analytics for Lua

## Overview

Add analytics to your Lua apps and Lua-scripted games with the - **still unfinished** - SnowPlow event tracker for [Lua] [lua].

With this tracker you can collect event data from your Lua-based applications, or from the Lua scripting layer within your games or apps.

## Notes

**TODO: move this into wiki.**

Snowplow Lua Tracker has a dependency on luasockets.

On Ubuntu:

    $ sudo aptitude install liblua5.1-socket2

For other environments, you'll have to check the Web for instructions on installing luasockets/bundling it with your app.
